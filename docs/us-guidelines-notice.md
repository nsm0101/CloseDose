# CloseDose: U.S.-Based Guidelines

## Current Implementation

CloseDose currently implements **United States pediatric dosing guidelines** for fever and pain medications. This page explains our current approach and provides resources for international users.

## What Guidelines We Follow

### Medication Names
- **Acetaminophen** (not paracetamol)
- **Ibuprofen**

### Dosing Approach
- **Weight-based dosing** (most accurate method)
- Supports both **pounds (lbs)** and **kilograms (kg)**
- Volume measurements in **milliliters (mL)**

### Medication Concentrations
- **Acetaminophen**: 160 mg/5 mL
- **Ibuprofen**: 
  - Infant drops: 50 mg/1.25 mL
  - Children's liquid: 100 mg/5 mL

### Dosing Calculations
- **Acetaminophen**: 
  - Infants (2-6 months): 12.5 mg/kg, max 160 mg
  - Children (6 months-11 years): 15 mg/kg, max 480 mg
  - Adolescents (12+ years): 15 mg/kg, max 1000 mg
- **Ibuprofen**: 10 mg/kg per dose
  - Children (6 months-11 years): max 400 mg
  - Adolescents (12+ years): max 800 mg

## For International Users

### ⚠️ Important Notes

**If you are using medications purchased outside the United States:**

1. **Check your medication concentration** - it may be different
2. **UK paracetamol**: Usually 120 mg/5 mL (different from U.S. 160 mg/5 mL)
3. **Dosing may need adjustment** for your specific medication
4. **Consult your local healthcare provider** for guidance

## Key Differences by Region

### Terminology
- **U.S. & Canada**: "Acetaminophen"
- **UK & Most International**: "Paracetamol"
- ℹ️ **These are the same medication**

### Dosing Philosophy
- **U.S.**: Weight-based dosing
- **Canada**: Weight-based dosing (more conservative)
- **UK**: Age-based dosing (with weight alternative)
- **WHO**: Weight-based, simplified

### Concentrations
- **U.S./Canada acetaminophen**: 160 mg/5 mL
- **UK paracetamol**: 120 mg/5 mL or 250 mg/5 mL
- **WHO paracetamol**: 125 mg/5 mL

## Universal Safety Guidelines

These apply **regardless of region**:

### 🚨 Emergency
**Fever in infant under 2-3 months = Medical Emergency**
- Call 911 (U.S./Canada) or 999 (UK) immediately

### ✅ Always
- Check medication concentration on bottle
- Use measuring device provided with medication
- Never use household spoons
- Follow minimum spacing between doses
- Never exceed maximum doses

### ❌ Never
- Guess or estimate doses
- Use expired medications
- Give adult formulations to children
- Mix medications without consulting healthcare provider

## Why We Use U.S. Guidelines

CloseDose was developed in the United States by U.S.-based healthcare providers, following:
- American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations
- FDA-approved medication standards
- Current U.S. clinical practice guidelines

**We are committed to**:
- Evidence-based dosing recommendations
- Safety-first approach
- Clear, accurate information
- Transparency about our guidelines

---

## Future International Versions

We recognize the need for region-specific versions of CloseDose. Our documentation includes detailed recommendations for:
- Canadian version (minor adjustments needed)
- UK version (significant adaptations required)
- WHO/International version (simplified approach)

**Considerations for future development**:
- Different medication concentrations
- Regional terminology (paracetamol vs. acetaminophen)
- Cultural approaches to fever management
- Metric-only interfaces for international markets
- Age-based dosing options (UK)
- Multiple language support

## Educational Resources

### Understanding Fever
- Fever is usually not dangerous
- Fever is the body's response to infection
- Medication is for comfort, not to "fix" fever
- Fever does not cause brain damage
- Treating fever does not prevent febrile seizures

### Common Misconceptions
1. ❌ "Paracetamol and acetaminophen are different"
   - ✅ Same medication, different names

2. ❌ "Always alternate medications"
   - ✅ Use one medication at a time unless advised otherwise

3. ❌ "Household teaspoons are fine"
   - ✅ Always use calibrated measuring devices

4. ❌ "Higher doses work better"
   - ✅ Correct dose = safe and effective

5. ❌ "Fever prevents febrile seizures"
   - ✅ No evidence supports this
