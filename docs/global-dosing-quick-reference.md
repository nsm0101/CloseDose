## Key Terminology Differences

### Acetaminophen vs. Paracetamol
**They are the same medication** (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol):
- **United States & Canada**: Called "Acetaminophen"
- **United Kingdom & Most International**: Called "Paracetamol"
- **Common brands**: Tylenol (US/Canada), Calpol (UK), Tempra (Canada)

### Ibuprofen
- **Name is consistent globally**: "Ibuprofen"
- **Common brands**: Advil/Motrin (US/Canada), Nurofen (UK)

## Quick Comparison: Dosing Approaches

### United States (Current CloseDose)
- **Method**: Weight-based dosing
- **Acetaminophen**: 12.5-15 mg/kg per dose
- **Ibuprofen**: 10 mg/kg per dose
- **Units**: Supports both lbs and kg
- **Concentration**: 160 mg/5 mL (acetaminophen), 50 mg/1.25 mL & 100 mg/5 mL (ibuprofen)

### Canada
- **Method**: Weight-based dosing
- **Acetaminophen**: 10-15 mg/kg per dose (emphasizes lower end)
- **Ibuprofen**: 5-10 mg/kg per dose
- **Units**: Primarily kg
- **Concentration**: Same as U.S. (160 mg/5 mL acetaminophen)
- **Cultural Note**: Strong emphasis on reducing "fever phobia"

### United Kingdom
- **Method**: Age-based dosing (with weight-based alternative)
- **Paracetamol**: Age-specific doses (e.g., 120 mg for 6-24 months)
- **Ibuprofen**: Age-specific doses (e.g., 100 mg for 1-4 years)
- **Units**: Exclusively kg and mL
- **Concentration**: 120 mg/5 mL (paracetamol) - **Different from U.S./Canada**
- **Cultural Note**: Conservative approach; comfort over temperature numbers

### WHO (International)
- **Method**: Weight-based dosing, simplified
- **Paracetamol**: 10-15 mg/kg per dose
- **Ibuprofen**: 5-10 mg/kg per dose
- **Units**: Metric only (kg, mL)
- **Concentration**: 125 mg/5 mL (paracetamol), 100 mg/5 mL (ibuprofen)
- **Cultural Note**: Emphasis on accessibility in resource-limited settings

## Important Safety Differences

### Age Restrictions

#### Acetaminophen/Paracetamol
- **U.S./Canada**: Can be used from birth with medical guidance; consult doctor under 3 months
- **UK**: Minimum age 2 months; only on medical advice under 2 months
- **All Regions**: **Fever in infants under 2-3 months is a medical emergency**

#### Ibuprofen
- **U.S./Canada/WHO**: Not recommended under 6 months
- **UK**: Can be used from 3 months with restrictions (must be assessed by physician for 3-6 months)

### Maximum Daily Doses

#### Acetaminophen/Paracetamol
- **U.S.**: Up to 5-6 doses per 24 hours
- **Canada**: Up to 5 doses per 24 hours
- **UK**: Maximum 4 doses per 24 hours ⚠️
- **WHO**: 4-6 doses per 24 hours

#### Ibuprofen
- **All Regions**: 3-4 doses per 24 hours, every 6-8 hours

## Common Misconceptions (All Regions)

### ❌ Myth 1: "Paracetamol and acetaminophen are different drugs"
✅ **Fact**: They are identical. Different names used in different regions.

### ❌ Myth 2: "Alternating medications is always better"
✅ **Fact**: 
- U.S.: Sometimes recommended for persistent fever
- UK/WHO: Generally discouraged; use one at a time
- Canada: May be used with caution
- Risk of dosing errors increases when alternating

### ❌ Myth 3: "Treating fever prevents febrile seizures"
✅ **Fact**: No evidence supports this. Fever medication is for comfort, not seizure prevention.

### ❌ Myth 4: "Household teaspoons are accurate enough"
✅ **Fact**: Household spoons vary significantly. **Always use the measuring device provided with medication.**

### ❌ Myth 5: "Higher fever needs higher doses"
✅ **Fact**: Use correct weight/age-based dose. Overdosing increases toxicity risk without improving effectiveness.

## Measurement Units

### Weight
- **U.S.**: Pounds (lbs) and kilograms (kg)
- **Canada**: Primarily kilograms (kg)
- **UK**: Kilograms (kg)
- **Conversion**: 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs

### Volume
- **All Regions**: Milliliters (mL) recommended
- **U.S. Note**: Avoid household teaspoons; 1 tsp ≈ 5 mL but not precise

### Temperature
- **U.S.**: Fahrenheit (°F) primary
- **Canada/UK/WHO**: Celsius (°C)
- **Fever**: ≥100.4°F (38°C)

## Medication Concentrations: Critical Differences

### ⚠️ Acetaminophen/Paracetamol - CHECK YOUR BOTTLE
| Region | Concentration | Note |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **U.S.** | 160 mg/5 mL | Standard since 2011 |
| **Canada** | 160 mg/5 mL | Same as U.S. |
| **UK** | 120 mg/5 mL or 250 mg/5 mL | **Different - requires conversion** |
| **WHO** | 125 mg/5 mL | May vary by country |

**Important**: When traveling or relocating, always check the concentration on your medication bottle and recalculate doses accordingly.

### Ibuprofen
| Region | Concentration | Note |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **U.S.** | 50 mg/1.25 mL (infant), 100 mg/5 mL (children's) | Two formulations |
| **Canada** | Similar to U.S. | Two formulations |
| **UK** | 100 mg/5 mL | Generally single concentration |
| **WHO** | 100 mg/5 mL | Standard |

## Using CloseDose with Different Guidelines

### Current Implementation
CloseDose uses **U.S.-based guidelines** with:
- Weight-based dosing (most accurate method)
- Support for both lbs and kg
- U.S. medication concentrations (160 mg/5 mL acetaminophen)
- U.S. maximum dose limits

### For International Users

#### Canadian Families
- CloseDose calculations are appropriate (same concentrations)
- Consider using lower end of dose range (10-12.5 mg/kg acetaminophen)
- Emphasize minimum effective dose

#### UK Families
- **⚠️ Different paracetamol concentration**: UK uses 120 mg/5 mL
- CloseDose calculations assume 160 mg/5 mL
- **Adjust mL amount**: Multiply CloseDose mL result by 1.33 for UK concentration
- Consider age-based dosing as used by NHS
- Maximum 4 doses per day (more conservative than U.S.)

#### International Families
- Check your medication concentration carefully
- CloseDose calculations may need adjustment
- Consult local healthcare guidelines
- When in doubt, contact a healthcare provider
