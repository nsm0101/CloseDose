          CloseDose LLC (“CloseDose”, “we”, “us”) provides weight-based pediatric dosing calculators and educational content for
          informational purposes only. The Services are intended for use by parents, caregivers, and healthcare professionals as a
          supplemental aid and are not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. By accessing CloseDose.com (the
          “Website”) or any related application, you agree to these Terms of Use.
