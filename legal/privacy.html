        <h2>SCOPE</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how CloseDose LLC collects, uses, and shares information when you use CloseDose.com and
          related services (collectively, the “Services”).
        </p>

        <h2>WHAT WE COLLECT</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to avoid collecting personal data. We do not request names, birth dates, or health records. We may collect limited
          device and usage data—such as IP address, browser type, pages viewed, referring URLs, and timestamps—through
          first-party analytics or privacy-respecting tools. If you contact us, we will receive the information you provide (for
          example, your email address and message content).
        </p>

        <h2>COOKIES</h2>
        <p>
          We may use strictly necessary cookies to maintain session preferences and optional analytics cookies to understand feature
          usage. You can control cookies through your browser settings.
        </p>

        <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          We use information to operate, maintain, and improve the Services; detect, prevent, and address technical issues; and
          respond to inquiries.
        </p>

        <h2>SHARING</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal information. We may share limited data with service providers who help us operate the Services
          (for example, hosting and analytics) under confidentiality obligations, or when required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>PHI</h2>
        <p>
          We do not request or store Protected Health Information (PHI). Do not enter identifiable health information into
          free-text forms.
        </p>

        <h2>DATA SECURITY &amp; RETENTION</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the limited data we handle. No method of
          transmission or storage is 100% secure. We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this
          Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
        <p>
          The Services are not directed to children under 13. Parents and caregivers may use the dosing calculators for their
          dependents.
        </p>

        <h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
        <p>
          You may disable cookies, use browser privacy controls, or contact us to request deletion of messages you have sent to us.
        </p>

        <h2>INTERNATIONAL USERS</h2>
        <p>
          If you access the Services from outside the United States, you consent to processing in the United States and to U.S.
          law.
        </p>

        <h2>CHANGES</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Policy and will post the new Effective Date when changes occur.
